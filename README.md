## Admin Panel

Administrators manage the platform through a dedicated admin panel at `/admin`, built with [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) and a custom Next.js UI layer.

The sidebar provides access to:

- **Courses** - create and organise the course catalog, set difficulty level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced), and link to a Subject
- **Modules** - group lessons within a course with ordering
- **Lessons** - build lesson content using the block-based editor (see [Lesson Builder](#lesson-builder--content-blocks))
- **Tasks** - create questions with prompts, answer choices, solutions, point values, and tag annotations
- **Subjects** - top-level topic taxonomy
- **Tags** - canonical knowledge tags shared across tasks and flashcards; power the recommendation engine
- **Flashcards** - create study cards linked to tags for the SRS system
- **Media** - upload and manage images and files backed by S3-compatible object storage
- **Settings** - global configuration (site title, default values)
- **Logs** - full audit trail of every administrative action (see [Activity Log](#activity-log--audit-trail))

---

## Draft → Publish Workflow

Every content type at every level of the hierarchy has an independent `isPublished` flag controlled by the admin. Students only ever see published content.

```
Subject  ──►  Course  ──►  Module  ──►  Lesson  ──►  Task
(published)  (published)  (published)  (published)  (published)
```

- A **Course** can be hidden in draft while its module structure is being built.
- A **Lesson** can be marked published independently - useful when releasing content progressively.
- A **Task** remains invisible to students until individually published.
- Admins always see all content regardless of publish state.

This gives content authors full control over what students see and when, without deleting content or creating branches.

---

## Lesson Builder & Content Blocks

Lessons are assembled from a sequence of typed content blocks. Admins add, reorder, and remove blocks freely in the Payload admin editor. Six block types are available:

### Text
Rich text powered by the Lexical editor. Supports headings, bold/italic, bullet and numbered lists, inline code, and links.

### Image
An image from the media library with configurable **width** (Small 400 px / Medium 600 px / Large 800 px / Full) and **alignment** (Left / Center / Right), plus an optional caption. Images are delivered through signed S3 URLs.

### Math
A LaTeX formula rendered with **KaTeX** on the client. Supports both **display mode** (centred block equation) and **inline mode** for formulas embedded in surrounding text. An optional descriptive note is displayed beneath the formula.

```
Example: x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```

### Callout
A highlighted box in one of three semantic variants:
- `info` - blue, for supplementary information
- `warning` - amber, for caveats and important notes
- `tip` - green, for helpful suggestions

Each callout contains its own rich text body.

### Video
An embedded YouTube video with selectable **aspect ratio** (16:9 widescreen or 4:3 standard), an optional title displayed above the player, and an optional caption below.

### Table
A structured data table with optional column headers. Supports a **caption** displayed above the table. Table data (headers and rows) is stored as JSON and rendered as a native HTML table.

---

## Task Types & Assessments

Each lesson can have any number of associated tasks. Three task types are supported:

| Type | Description | Grading |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Multiple Choice** | A list of labelled options; one is correct | Automatic - matched against `correctAnswer` |
| **True / False** | Binary choice question | Automatic - matched against `"true"` or `"false"` |
| **Open Ended** | Free-text answer | Manual by default; optional **auto-grade** mode normalises and compares text case- and punctuation-insensitively |

Every task can include:
- A **rich text prompt** with full formatting
- An optional **question image** from the media library
- A **solution / explanation** in rich text, shown after submission
- An optional **solution image** and/or **solution video URL** (YouTube)
- **Tags** linking the task to the knowledge taxonomy
- A configurable **point value** and **display order**

---

## Adaptive Learning Engine

The recommendation engine builds a per-user skill model from task submission history:

1. **Tag weakness scores** - for each tag the student has encountered, the engine computes a score based on recent answer accuracy and recency weighting.
2. **Personalized task queue** - tasks tagged with the student's weakest knowledge areas are surfaced first at `/api/recommend/tasks`.
3. **Analytics dashboard** - admins and students can view per-tag performance breakdowns. Results are cached with a 60-second TTL and invalidated automatically on new submissions.

The full algorithm is documented in [ADAPTIVE_LEARNING.md](CourseManagementPlatform/documentation/ADAPTIVE_LEARNING.md).

---

## Spaced Repetition Flashcards

The flashcard system implements the **SM-2** algorithm with Anki's state-machine extensions.

Each card tracks an independent per-user state:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `NEW` | Never studied |
| `LEARNING` | In short learning steps (minutes-based scheduling) |
| `REVIEW` | Long-term spaced repetition (days-based scheduling) |
| `RELEARNING` | Failed a REVIEW card; returns to short steps before re-entering REVIEW |
| `MASTERED` | Interval ≥ 21 days (continues to be reviewed normally) |

When reviewing a card the student chooses one of four answers - **Again**, **Hard**, **Good**, **Easy** - and the algorithm updates the interval and ease factor accordingly. Learning steps are configurable (default: 1 min → 10 min → graduate to REVIEW at 1 day). Ease is clamped at a minimum of 1.3 to prevent cards from becoming impossibly infrequent.

Cards are linked to **tags**, so the SRS session can be filtered to a particular topic.

---

## Activity Log & Audit Trail

A persistent `activity_logs` table records every significant admin action. The admin **Logs** page at `/admin/logs` displays a paginated, filterable table of all entries.

Actions covered include:

- **Authentication** - `USER_REGISTERED`, `USER_LOGIN`, `USER_LOGOUT`, `USER_LOGIN_FAILED`
- **Subject / Course / Module / Lesson / Task** - created, updated, published, unpublished, deleted
- **Flashcard & Tag** - created, updated, deleted
- **Media** - uploaded, deleted

Each log entry stores the actor's user ID and email, the affected resource type and ID, a UTC timestamp, and an optional JSON metadata payload (e.g. the resource title).

Filters available in the admin panel: action type, actor user ID, date range. All filters are reflected in the URL for bookmarkable views.

The logging design is fire-and-forget - a logging failure never disrupts the primary operation.

---

## Media Management

All uploaded files are stored in an **S3-compatible** object store (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Railway Object Storage, or any compatible API).

- Files are uploaded through the Payload CMS **Media** collection and stored with generated unique keys.
- Delivered via **pre-signed URLs** with a configurable expiry - no public bucket policy required.
- Usage is tracked per file so admins can see which lessons and tasks reference a given asset before deletion.
- Supported by all lesson content blocks (images in Image blocks, question and solution media on tasks).

---

## Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| Authentication | Auth.js v5 with hashed (bcrypt) passwords |
| Session tokens | JWT with JTI field; a `token_blocklist` table enables instant revocation on logout |
| Rate limiting | Per-IP sliding window on all auth endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) |
| Input validation | Zod schemas on all API routes and server actions |
| Content Security Policy | Strict CSP with **per-request nonces** for inline scripts; `img-src` restricted to known storage hostnames |
| Access control | Role-based (`ADMIN` / `STUDENT`) enforced at the Payload collection level and in server actions |
| Query safety | Prisma parameterized queries throughout; no raw SQL string interpolation |

## Content imports (bulk data)

Besides the admin UI, you can load **tags, full courses (subject → modules → lessons → tasks), extra modules on an existing course, and flashcards** from data files under the app. Imports are **idempotent**: re-running updates existing records that match the same keys (slugs, order fields, and so on) instead of duplicating everything.

**Requirements:** a running database, `DATABASE_URL` (or `PAYLOAD_DATABASE_URL`) and `PAYLOAD_SECRET` in `.env`, same as normal app usage.

From the **app directory** (the folder that contains `package.json`, e.g. `LearningPlatform/LearningPlatform`):

```bash
npm run content:import:all
```

Stage-specific scripts exist as well (`content:import:tags`, `content:import:course`, `content:import:modules`, `content:import:flashcards`). Use `--dry-run` on a runner to print what would change without writing.

**File format and shapes** (where to put new files, how each export must look) are documented here:

**[LearningPlatform/scripts/imports/README.md](LearningPlatform/scripts/imports/README.md)**

Docker: after the stack is up, `docker compose --env-file .env exec app npm run content:import:all` (rebuild or mount `scripts/imports` if you change data files; see `LearningPlatform/DOCKER.md`).

---

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test            # single run
npm run test:coverage   # with coverage report
npm run test:watch      # watch mode
```

404 tests total (unit, integration, component) with Vitest and Testing Library. The default `npm run test:ci` / GitHub Actions job runs **392** of them; **12** Payload- or DB-heavy integration tests are skipped unless you run against a real database (see `SKIP_PAYLOAD_TESTS` / `SKIP_DB_SETUP` in the test files).

---

## Deployment

The platform can be deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) using the included `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml`.

On container start, `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs all pending Prisma migrations synchronously before the Next.js server starts, ensuring the schema is always up to date before traffic is accepted.

### Required environment variables

```
DATABASE_URL
PAYLOAD_DATABASE_URL
AUTH_SECRET
PAYLOAD_SECRET
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
NEXTAUTH_URL
S3_BUCKET
AWS_REGION
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
